# Central Code Storage of the Image Guidance Lab

Hey there,

Lucius, Ziqian and Darius thought about bringing some order into all the important scripts and other code-fragments floating around.

Therefore we would like to bring everyone occupied with some way of creating code or scripts (Python, MatLab, R, C++, Bash) to store their work in a repository (a storage entity for a specific project in git's world) of this GitHub organization.

This brings several advantages with it:
* Backup of your work in case of disk failure, fire, flooding, accidental deletion, etc.
* Comfortable way of collaboration, discussion, showcasing of code
* Possibility of [citing codes in scientific papers](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)

Additionally we would like to provide an 'Onboarding' repository in the future with helpful guides and links to tutorials on how to use commonly used tools such as for tractography, connectomics, scripting, scientific writing, TMS and more.

If you are new to Git please work through this great introduction:

The planned structure for our repos is planned to be as follows:
- This *Index* Repo provides a starting point and overview of the other repos. [Here](https://github.com/CUB-IGL/Wiki/blob/main/Index.md) you find a list of all the repos by project/study as well as by used technologies/analysis methods (you need to have access rights for this. Please contact Darius and tell your GH username)
- A *Common tasks* repo will provide blueprints for tasks like preprocessing of DWI volumes, common tractography use-cases, connectome construction and more
- *Project specific* repos will be created for each individual project or study
