# Central Code Storage of the Image Guidance Lab

Hey there :wave:

Lucius, Ziqian and Darius thought about bringing some order into all the important scripts and other code-fragments floating around.

Therefore we would like to bring everyone occupied with some way of creating code or scripts (Python, MatLab, R, C++, Bash) to store their work in a repository (a storage entity for a specific project in git's world) of this GitHub organization.

This brings several advantages with it:
* Backup of your work in case of disk failure, fire, flooding, accidental deletion, etc. :closed_lock_with_key:
* Comfortable way of collaboration, discussion, showcasing of code :speaking_head:
* Possibility of [citing codes in scientific papers](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) :page_facing_up:

Additionally we would like to provide an 'Onboarding' repository for new members of IGL in the future with helpful guides and links to tutorials on how to use commonly used technologies and get familiar with concepts such as for tractography, connectomics, scripting, scientific writing, TMS and more.

The planned structure for our repos is planned to be as follows:
- The *Common tasks* repo will provide blueprints for tasks like preprocessing of DWI volumes, common tractography use-cases, connectome construction, Matlab and R anaylsis and more
- *Project specific* repos will be created for each individual project or study
- The [Wiki](https://github.com/CUB-IGL/Wiki/) repo will hold some Tutorials as well as an [**Index**](https://github.com/CUB-IGL/Wiki/blob/main/Index.md) used to find specific scripts and code-snippets.

If you're new to git and/or GitHub, Darius has provided an introductory step-by-step guide on how to bring your work on GitHub [here](https://github.com/CUB-IGL/Wiki/blob/main/CreateRepo.md).

**But don't we have Basecamp already?**
> Yes we have Basecamp, but the use-cases for Basecamp and GitHub are quite different:  
> Basecamp is a project-management software while GitHub is a hoster of a version control system (git).
> We think that GitHub is a better choice for the goals described above and are therefore happy to try to establish it next to Basecamp.

We hope that this effort will make the highly technical work processes in IGL more efficient, increase safety regarding loss of work and data, as well as improve collaboration and help to learn from others.
